# Deployment Manager Swagger
Deployment manager provides a REST api for interacting with many of the resources available in the Deployment Manager UI.
This can be helpful for integrating with other systems.

The documentation for these API's can be found by opening `DeploymentManager-RestApi/index.html` in a browser.

If you would like to use Swagger's "Try it out" feature, you will need to update the `host` value in `DeploymentManager-RestApi/swagger.yaml` and view the swagger using OpenAPI tools.
